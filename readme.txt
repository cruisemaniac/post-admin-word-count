== Description ==

Post Word Count adds a sortable column to the admin's post manager, displaying the word count for each post.

I often create new drafts in WordPress every time I get an idea to blog. The problem was I had no easy way to see which drafts I had already started working on. This plugin allows me to sort all of my posts, including my drafts, by the posts word count.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'post-word-count' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPresss
